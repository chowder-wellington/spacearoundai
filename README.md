An emulator of a "sentient" AI

The model itself is in fact, not by us, and we are using groq's servers
I'm sure if you felt inclined you could make it run locally but this is fine for now

The thing is pretty much a chatbot with a few bells and whistles and object recognition from a live video stream.

Full documentation on the emulator and the actual implementation in the real world:
